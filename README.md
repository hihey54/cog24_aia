### Description

This repository contains the following relevant files:

* ``supplementary.pdf`` which is a supplementary document that extends our paper by providing more details on our literature review as well as some recommendations we received from some of the communities in which we disseminated our survey.
* ``survey_multi-game.pdf`` which is the "generic" survey we distributed in our user study (anonymised).
* ``first.png`` and ``end.png`` which are the first and last "pages" of the survey, showcasing that we revealed our identities and (institutional) contact details, and that we informed our participants of that our user study also entailed attribute inference attacks (at the end of the survey).
